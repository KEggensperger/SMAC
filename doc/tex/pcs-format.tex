\section{Introduction}

\noindent{}This document specifies the PCS parameter configuration space format, a simple, 
human-readable file format for the description of an algorithm's configurable parameters, 
their possible values, as well as any parameter dependencies. Additionally Section \ref{sec:tips} contains advice on encoding parameters for use by the algorithm wrapper.
%This format is emerging as a standard in algorithm configuration, with the prominent configuration methods ParamILS, SMAC, and GGA supporting it.

\section{Interplay With Algorithm Wrapper}\label{sec:tips}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This file specifies the parameters of an algorithm, but it does not specify how to pass these parameters to your algorithm.
The specifics of that are defined by the algorithm wrapper, which receives an instantiation of parameters,
calls your algorithm with that instantiation (typically through a command line call) and returns the performance result. 

In typical cases, there is a direct 1-to-1 mapping between the parameters in the PCS file and the parameters the corresponding algorithm accepts.
In those cases, the wrapper simply hands the parameters over to the algorithm.
However, the wrapper can also implement transformations of parameters, scale parameters by instance size, etc.
