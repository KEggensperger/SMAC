\textsc{Note:} For non-\texttt{master} builds these commits may not contain everything in the build. (\ie{,non-\texttt{master} builds can be built with uncommitted changes}). If the dirty flag is 0 that means the commit contains this exact copy, 1 means there were some uncommitted changes, and something else means some other error occurred when we tried to generate this.

\textsc{Note:} ACLib above refers to AEATK, the Algorithm Execution \& Abstraction Toolkit which SMAC is built upon. At the time of this build, it was in the middle of transition between ACLib and AEATK.
