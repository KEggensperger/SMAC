We are indebted to Jonathan Shen for porting our random forest code from C to Java in preparation for a Java port of all of SMAC. We thank Marius Schneider for many valuable bug reports and suggestions for improvements. Thanks also to Chris Thornton for being a secondary beta tester.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Return Codes}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
\hline
Value & Error Name & Description \\
\hline
\hline
0 & \textbf{Success} & Everything completed successfully \\
\hline
1 & \textbf{Parameter Error} & There was a problem with the input arguments or files  \\
\hline
2 & \textbf{Trajectory Divergence} & For some reason SMAC has taken a unexpected path \\

& & (\eg{} SMAC executes a run that does not match a run \\
& & in the \textbf{-~$\!\!$-runHashCodeFile}) \\
\hline
3 & \textbf{Serialization Exception} & A problem occurred when saving or restoring state \\
\hline
255 & \textbf{Other Exceptions} & Some other error occurred \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textsc{NOTE:} All error conditions for besides 255, are fixed. However in future some exceptions that previously reported 255 may be changed to a non 255 value as needed.

\subsection{Version History of Java SMAC}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Version 2.00] First Java release of SMAC (this is a port and extension of the original Matlab version).
	\end{description}
\subsection{Known Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trajectory file does not output standard deviation
\item Using any alias for -$~\!$-showHiddenParameters, -$~\!$-help, or -$~\!$-version as values to other arguments (\eg{ Setting -$~\!$-runGroupName -$~\!$-help}) does not parse correctly (This is unlikely to be fixed until someone complains).
\end{enumerate}
