We are indebted to Jonathan Shen for porting our random forest code from C to Java in preparation for a Java port of all of SMAC. Alexandre Fr\'echette and Chris Thornton for their constant feedback and patches to SMAC.  We would also like to thank Marius Schneider for many valuable early bug reports and suggestions for improvements.

\subsection{Return Codes}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
\hline
Value & Error Name & Description \\
\hline
\hline
0 & \textbf{Success} & Everything completed successfully \\
\hline
1 & \textbf{Parameter Error} & There was a problem with the input arguments or files  \\
\hline
2 & \textbf{Trajectory Divergence} & For some reason SMAC has taken a unexpected path \\

& & (\eg{} SMAC executes a run that does not match a run \\
& & in the \textbf{-~$\!\!$-runHashCodeFile}) \\
\hline
3 & \textbf{Serialization Exception} & A problem occurred when saving or restoring state \\
\hline
255 & \textbf{Other Exceptions} & Some other error occurred \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textsc{NOTE:} All error conditions besides 255 are fixed. However in future some exceptions that previously reported 255 may be changed to a non 255 value as needed / requested

\subsection{Version History of Java SMAC}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Version 2.00 (Aug-2012)] First Internal Release of Java SMAC (this is a port and extension of the original Matlab version).
		\item[Version 2.02 (Oct-2012)] First Public Release of SMAC v2 and contained many fixes from the previous release.
		\item[Version 2.04 (Dec-2012)] Second Release of Java SMAC including the following improvements:
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item Validation file output times consistent with Tuner Times
			\item Some \textbf{INFO} log statements have been moved to \textbf{DEBUG} and some \textbf{DEBUG} to \textbf{TRACE}
			\item Added support for verifying whether responses of SAT and UNSAT are consistent with Instance Specific Information see \textbf{-$~\!$-verifySAT} option for more information
			\item Added support for the SMAC\_MEMORY environment variable to control how much RAM (in MB) SMAC will use when  executed via the supplied shell scripts. 
			\item Context is now added to the state folders to make it easier to debug issues later, to disable consult the \textbf{-$~\!$-saveContext} option.
			\item Greatly improved memory usage in State Serialization code, and now we free the existing model prior to building a new one, so for some JVMs this may improve memory usage.
			\end{enumerate}

			\item[Version 2.04.01 (Feb-2013)] Minor Bug Fix of Java SMAC
				\begin{enumerate}
 			\item Added option to validate over training set instances 
			\item Can now use $<$DEFAULT$>$ as a configuration to validate against
			\item Fixed bug where \textbf{TIMEOUT} runs below our requested cutoff time are not counted properly when considering incumbent changes
			\item Can now specify the initial incumbent with the \textbf{-$~\!$-initialIncumbent} option.
			\item Wallclock time is now saved in the trajectory file instead of -1
			\item FAQ Improvements
			\item Git commit hash is now documented in Manual, FAQ, and Version strings
			\item \textbf{(BETA)} Support for bash auto-completion of arguments for \texttt{smac} and \texttt{smac-validate}. You can load the file by running: 
\begin{verbatim}
. ./util/bash_autocomplete.sh
\end{verbatim}

			\end{enumerate}

			 \item[Version 2.04.02 (Aug-2013)] Minor Bug Fix of Java SMAC
	              \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Incumbent Performance now displayed when validation is turned off.
                     \item \textbf{-$~\!$-runtimeLimit} option is no longer just for show.
                  \end{enumerate}

			 \item[Version 2.06.00b (Aug-2013)] Preview Release of SMAC v2.06
	              \begin{enumerate}
	              	 \item New \texttt{algo-test} utility allows easy invocation of wrappers.
	              	 \item New \texttt{verify-scenario} utility preforms extra validation on scenario files.
                     \item Scenario now ends if the configuration space is exhausted
					 \item SMAC now lets you search only a subspace for good configurations
					 \item Validation output formats improved with headers
					 \item Option to always compare with the initial incumbent (to prevent an early poor choice from derailing the run) (See \textbf{-$~\!$-always-run-initial-config})
					 \item SMAC reports an error if runs give different answers for \textbf{SAT} and \textbf{UNSAT} now
					 \item New \textbf{-$~\!$-restore-scenario} option to make restoring scenarios easier
					 \item New \textbf{-$~\!$-warmstart} option makes it possible to preload the model with additional SMAC runs.
					 \item Can now set seeds to different parts of SMAC using \textbf{-S}
					 \item Runtime Statistics and Termination Reasons now rewritten
					 \item New validation options \textbf{-$~\!$-validate-all}, \textbf{-$~\!$-validate-only-if-tunertime-reached} (See the validation options for all of them)
					 \item SMAC now checks limits \textit{before} scheduling a run, rather than immediately after the run as in previous versions. (This means that if the last run went over, but changed the incumbent it will be logged.)
					 \item Instances can now be ordered deterministically (that is in the order they are declared in the instance file via \textbf{-$~\!$-determinstic-instance-ordering}.
					 \item Usage improved via new help levels which are displayed with \textbf{-$~\!$-help-level} and new usage screens.
					 \item Improvements to bash auto completion.
					 \item Target Algorithm Evaluators now take options.
					 \item Fixes for CPU Time calculation in SMAC.
					 \item Example scenarios cleaned up, new ones provided.
					 \item SMAC should be more forgiving with relative paths in a scenario file.
					 \item Default option files now supported (SMAC will read from \texttt{~/.aclib/smac.opt}, \texttt{~/.aclib/tae.opt} and \texttt{~/.aclib/help.opt}. It will also read from defaults for plugins that are available.
					 \item Rungroup name is now configurable.
					 \item Logging of some objects is cleaned up.
					 \item Windows Startup scripts, and improved Unix start up scripts.
					 \item Fixed lock-up issue with wrappers launching unterminating subprocesses.
					 \item Fixed ConvergenceException error message.
					 \item Options now have a primary non-camel case format.
					 \item Manual now has a basic options section, before listing all the options.
					 \item Significant API changes to the Target Algorithm Evaluators so previous plugins will need to be refactored (and another change will come either in v2.06 or v2.08).
					 \item SMAC will now match capitalization of words in the Result String of wrappers.
					 \item New \textbf{-$~\!$-validation-seed} option should cause the validation at the end of SMAC to behave the same as the stand-alone utility.
                  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Known Issues}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using any alias for \textbf{-$~\!$-showHiddenParameters}, \textbf{-$~\!$-help}, or \textbf{-$~\!$-version} as values to other arguments (\eg{ Setting -$~\!$-runGroupName -$~\!$-help}) does not parse correctly (This is unlikely to be fixed until someone complains).
\item Using large parameter values in continuous integral parameters, may cause loss of precision, and or crashes if the values are too big.
\item On older versions of Java ($<$1.6.0\_23), SMAC  may get an IOException with Out Of Memory when trying to execute the target algorithms
