	SMAC uses slf4j (\url{http://www.slf4j.org/}), a library that allows for abstracting and replacing the logging system with ease, and uses logback (\url{http://logback.qos.ch/}) as the default logging system. While there is limited ability to change logging options via the command line (\eg{, \textbf{-$~\!$-log-level}, \textbf{-$~\!$-console-log-level}, \textbf{-$~\!$-log-all-call-strings},\textbf{-$~\!$-log-all-process-output}}). It is possible that by setting a system property\footnote{You'd have to edit the start up script smac or smac.bat}  you can override the configuration by using \texttt{-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml}

	
	\textsc{Note:} If you replace the logger in SMAC or modify the configuration file, the logging command line options may no longer work.
